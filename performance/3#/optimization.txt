OPTIMIZATION: MATCH FINDING - REDUNDANT COMPARISONS
=============================================================

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added guard condition to minMatchDiff loop (if minMatchDiff > 0)
   - Skips unnecessary loop iterations when minMatchDiff is 0
   
2. Added early exit in minMatchDiff loop (if maxDiff >= maxD)
   - Terminates loop as soon as maximum distance is found
   
3. Kept original diff accumulation (diff += instead of diff =)
   - Critical for correct hash chain traversal
